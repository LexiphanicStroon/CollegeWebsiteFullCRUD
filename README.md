This is built with ASP.NET Core and a code first database that writes to a sql instance. 
You can create instances of teachers, students, and courses that only allow you to enter valid information and available courses.
You can update the database from the front-end, and there is client-side validation done
with TypeScript so nothing that will throw an error can be passed to the database.
UI is made with bootstrap framework. 
Some custom javascript functions
